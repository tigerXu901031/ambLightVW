\par Introduction
Setup with T3 as core
    - T3 as incremental mode
    	- Multiplication factor:
    		- twoFold: use both edges of TxIn
    		- fourFold: use both edges of TxIn and TxEUD
   		- Reverse of direction supported by GPT12
   		- T3 value diff is used for speed calculation at high speed (speed > speedModeThreshold)
    - T4 used for zero signal detection if  pinZ is not NULL
    	- interrupt is generated to support turn calculation if zeroIsrPriority != 0
    	- T4 clears T3 on zero signal event on TxIn input
    - T5 used for low speed calculation (speed < speedModeThreshold)
   		- Rising edge of TxIn or TxEUD captures the T5 timer in CAPREL
  
   Setup with T2 as core
    - T2 as incremental mode
    	- Multiplication factor:
    		- twoFold: sample on both edges of TxIn
    		- fourFold: sample on both edges of TxIn and TxEUD
   		- Reverse of direction supported by GPT12
   		- T2 value diff is used for speed calculation at high speed
    - T4 used for zero signal detection if  pinZeroTxEUD is not NULL
    - T4 clears T2 on zero signal event on TxEUD input
